## 1. Understanding Tokens and Tokenizers in Large Language Models (LLMs)

In this tutorial, you will learn about the importance of tokens and tokenizers in LLMs. Tokens are the fundamental building blocks of text data that LLMs understand and manipulate. They can be individual words, subwords, or special characters. The tutorial covers:

- Why LLMs use tokens for computational efficiency and vocabulary management.
- The role of tokenizers in breaking down text into smaller, more manageable units.

## 2. Embeddings: The Secret Sauce of Large Language Models (LLMs)

This tutorial explores the concept of embeddings and their crucial role in helping LLMs understand the nuances of language. Embeddings are numerical vectors that encode the semantic relationships between words in a multidimensional space. The tutorial covers:

- What are embeddings and why they are essential for LLMs.
- How embeddings capture the learned features and attributes of language.

## 3. Semantic Indexing: Unlocking Meaningful Search for Large Language Models

Semantic indexing is a powerful technique that goes beyond keyword matching to enable efficient information retrieval from LLMs. This tutorial explains:

- What semantic indexing is and how it differs from traditional keyword-based search.
- The role of sentence transformers in capturing semantic relationships between words and sentences.
- How embeddings enable LLMs to understand the essence of a query and its connection to stored information.

## 4. Question-Answering with Transformers: Empowering LLMs to Find Answers

This tutorial dives into the world of question-answering (QA) with transformers and how it enables LLMs to directly answer user queries. The tutorial covers:

- What QA with transformers is and how it leverages the power of neural network architectures.
- How LLMs extract context, comprehend queries, and generate answers using QA with transformers.

## 5. Fine-Tuning T5 with Transformers for LLMs

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to fine-tune the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model using Transformers, a popular deep learning library for natural language processing (NLP). Fine-tuning allows you to specialize general-purpose LLMs for specific tasks. The tutorial covers:

- What fine-tuning is and why it's useful for LLMs.
- An introduction to the T5 model and the Transformers library.

## 6. Understanding GPT-2 Instruct with Transformers for LLMs

This tutorial focuses on GPT-2 Instruct, which combines the power of GPT-2 with instruction-following capabilities using transformers. The tutorial covers:

- The core concept of GPT-2 Instruct and how it combines GPT-2 with instruction following.
- The benefits of GPT-2 Instruct, including improved task-oriented performance, enhanced control and flexibility, and potential for broader applications.
